Hey team, quick update on the New Hire data sync work.

I've been rebuilding the newHireAutoSyncData script from scratch, and I wanted to share some context on why I went this route instead of patching the old one.

While using the previous script, I ran into a couple of major issues:

1. **Missing data — a lot of it.** When I compared the old script against the new one using the same time range (Start Date from 4/4/2024 onward), the old script only captured 8,196 records (excluding duplicates), while the new one pulled in 12,124. That's roughly 4,000 records that were completely missed. As a quick example — for 2/12/2026 alone, there should be 4 records, but the old script only had 2.

2. **Date formatting inconsistencies.** There were a lot of ambiguous and inconsistent date formats across the source data, which caused sorting and filtering issues downstream.

Given the scale of these problems, I decided it would be faster and more reliable to build a new script from the ground up rather than keep debugging the old one.

This time around, I worked with Cursor AI to add a clean set of UI menu options directly in the sheet, so the functions are easy to use and clearly organized. You can check out the full function guide here:

The synced data lives here:

I'd really appreciate it if you could take a few minutes over the next couple of days to spot-check the data and see how the sync is performing. If you notice anything off — missing records, weird formatting, anything — just flag it for me. I'll be back on Thursday and will jump straight into optimizations based on whatever feedback comes in.

Thanks!
